## Usage
`md-exec` could exec the commands in the Markdown files.
For instance, it will execute those commands which in Markdown block via `mde README.md`

```shell
#!title: Print ip info
ifconfig
```

## Limitation
Please make sure the Markdown files meet Linux end-of-line.
You could turn it via: `dos2unix your.md`
